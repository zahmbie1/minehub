# Minehub
Minehub is a place where people on scratch can share their minecraft creations! If you have a creation you want to share, comment on my scratch profile at scratch.mit.edu/users/zahmbie1 or go to TBA. To share, you will need a cubeupload account, as I need a picture of your creation.

Terms of use:
You acknowledge that your creation will become public to all to see.
You acknowledge that I will credit you with your scratch profile name and link to your scratch account.
