# Minehub
Minehub is a place where people on scratch can share their minecraft creations! If you have a creation you want to share, comment on my scratch profile at https://scratch.mit.edu/users/zahmbie1 or go to https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/470567/ To share, you will need a cubeupload account, as I need a picture of your creation.

<p>Terms of use:</p>
<p>You acknowledge that your creation will become public to all to see.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that I will credit you with your scratch profile name and link to your scratch account.</p>
